# Customer Segmentation Analysis


## Project Overview
This project delivers an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for customer segmentation.  
It applies **K-Means clustering** to automatically group customers into meaningful segments, enabling businesses to better understand their customer base and make data-driven decisions.  


Unlike a standard analysis, this solution goes further by providing a **Streamlit web application** where users can:  
- Upload their own dataset  
- Select numeric features for clustering  
- Automatically determine the optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method)  
- Visualise clusters in 2D with PCA  
- Explore cluster summaries and sizes  
- Download the enriched dataset with assigned cluster labels  

This makes it a **practical tool** for analysts, product managers, and financial institutions who want actionable insights.
